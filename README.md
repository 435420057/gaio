Status: Work in progress

## Features

0. If memory is your concern, this library may work for you.
1. Only a fixed number of goroutines will be created per Watcher.
2. The event notifications on a Watcher is sequential, that means can optimize buffer usage.
3. You can only have one reader and one writer on a specific connection at one time, newer ones will replace the old ones.
4. Non-intrusive design, this library works on net.Listener and net.Conn. (with Syscall.RawConn support)
5. Support for Linux, BSD
